/*
Question2: what is encapsulation?
Encapsulation is an object oriented programming concept which talks about binding together the data and the functions that manipulate the data.
Encapsulation is also about specifying specific access level, such as public, protected and private.
Class is an example of encapsulation. If we have created some class and have data member and function member and set up reasonable access control, the data and functions are grouped for convenient use.
