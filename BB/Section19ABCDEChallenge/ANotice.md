## principles of work flow.
1. edit file in working copy from vim, save to it.
2. Mobile C should be flushed instantly after a test is over. It should be an empty Lab.
3. vim should also be an empty place. It's only a potential trouble if not.

what if changes are made in Mobile C? import it to working copy and then delete it.
