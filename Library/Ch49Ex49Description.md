## I googled "letter, ascender, descender" and finally understood the problem.

//  Chaper 9 Ex 9.49
//  description
//	A letter has an ascender if, as with d or f, part of the letter extends
//          above the middle of the line.
//          A letter has a descender if, as with p or g, part of the letter extends below the line.
//          Write a program that reads a file containing words and reports the longest word
//          that contains neither ascenders nor descenders.

## when something completely new is encountered, google it instantly, and don't be frightened:)
