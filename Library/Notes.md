## notes

organize a program (indevelopment) using class is always optional.

STL containers are reliable, which means the corner cases are handled.

STL containers are tested by millions of lines of code, no surprises.

containers are templates, which means the user interface and implementation are seperated completely even farther.

naming conventions in STL are expertise knowledge.

basic operations such as traversal, insertion and deletion can be implemented in different frameworks, but we can alway choose one as the best of all.

the before_begin method as part of interface design is cute.
    iterator forward_list::before_begin ();
    
## TODO

Write working code deleting odd numbers from a list using ForwardList.h, ie, invent a wheel.
