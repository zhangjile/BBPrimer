## git is the upstream code base, Mobile C is a tesing facility

if a file in Mobile C contains change, it's high possibility to cause conflict.

## milestones

Empty Mobile C file folders. done!

new workflow imports code files instead of copy and paste, a substantial step forward.

time complexity is becoming a key word in daily exercise.

## issues

1. build failure with PersonInfo, /Basics/Chapter8IOLibrary/
possible solution: upgrade gcc

2. split a file of integers, put odd numbers in a file and even numbers in another.
perfect code, successful build, but output is null, /Library/Ch10Ex33argviostreamiterator/

3. /Library/Ch11Ex3, word counting, a bug that space is taken as a string and counted 67 occurences

4. /Library/Ch10Ex34ReverseIterator, check out the  distance the tricky algorithm
