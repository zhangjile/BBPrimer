## git is the upstream code base, Mobile C is a tesing facility

if a file in Mobile C contains change, it's high possibility to cause conflict.

## milestones

Empty Mobile C file folders. done!

new workflow imports code files instead of copy and paste, a substantial step forward.

time complexity is becoming a key word in daily exercise.

## issues

1. build failure with PersonInfo, /Basics/Chapter8IOLibrary/
possible solution: upgrade gcc
status: bug fixed

2. split a file of integers, put odd numbers in a file and even numbers in another.
perfect code, successful build, but output is null, /Library/Ch10Ex33argviostreamiterator/

3. /Library/Ch11Ex3, word counting, a bug that space is taken as a string and counted 67 occurences

4. /Library/Ch10Ex34ReverseIterator, check out the  distance the tricky algorithm 


"If you're an experienced C++ programmer and are anything like me, you initially approached C++11 thinking, "Yes, yes, I get it. It's C++, only more so." But as you learned more, you were surprised by the scope of the changes. auto declarations, range-based for loops, lambda expressions, and rvalue references change the face of C++, to say nothing of the new concurrency features. And then there are the idiomatic changes. 0 and typedefs are out, nullptr and alias declarations are in. Enums should now be scoped. Smart pointers are now preferable to built-in ones. Moving objects is normally better than copying them.
- Effective Modern C++ by Scott Meyers
